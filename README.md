# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
```

## Needed tools

We need Chainlink VRF and Chainlink Keepers.

## Additional Information

hardhat-deploy for deploying.

```
npm install -D hardhat-deploy
yarn add -D @nomicfoundation/hardhat-ethers hardhat-deploy-ethers ethers
```
